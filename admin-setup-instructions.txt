# CyberShieldX Admin Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your admin account on your private server:

## 1. Install the required packages

Run these commands to install the required packages:

```bash
# Install Node.js (if not already installed)
apt install nodejs -y

# Install npm (Node.js package manager)
apt install npm -y

# Install PostgreSQL client library
apt install libpq-dev -y

# Install pg npm package (PostgreSQL client for Node.js)
npm install pg
```

## 2. Run the admin setup script

Copy the ensure-admin-fixed.js file to your server and then run:

```bash
node ensure-admin-fixed.js
```

When prompted:
- Enter your PostgreSQL database connection details
- For admin credentials, you can press Enter to use defaults:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: password123

## 3. Log in to your CyberShieldX platform

After running the script successfully, you can log in with:
- Username: admin
- Password: password123

You will be prompted to change your password after your first login.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a "database does not exist" error:

1. Create the database:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   CREATE DATABASE cybershieldx;
   \q
   ```

2. Run the application migration script to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/cybershieldx
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. Then run the admin setup script again.
